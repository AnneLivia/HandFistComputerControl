<p align="center"></h2>
With the advancement of technology, systems that enable a more natural and accessible human-computer interaction will have a very positive impact on society. Therefore, this research proposes the development of a low computational cost software process that allows remote interaction with the computer through the detection of hands via webcam, using the Haar Cascade classification algorithm. The results obtained were considered satisfactory, indicating an accuracy of 82%, recall of 80%, F1-score of 81% and an adequate and efficient response time for the interaction with several computational applications in real time.
